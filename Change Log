11/22/24 7:30 - 8:30PM - Valerie and Dristi HTML Work Session
Files Added & Changed:
  - index.html
  - saved_recipes.html
  - search_page.html
Functionality Added/Worked on:
We made .html files for the different pages of the webpage. We worked on the linking functionality between pages. On the home page (index.html), we made a recipe of the day section and a top recipes section.
The saved recipes and search sections have the same code as the home page currently, but we will make changes to these next time we meet. Additionaly, we decided that when we press on a certain recipe card,
a modal display of the recipe will be shown rather than a whole other page. We will work on implementing this next time we meet.
Issues/Confusions:
  - Figuring out how to push work onto Github (using branches)
  - We somehow could not push our work to the main branch as it said that there was information that on the local that was not on the remote.

Files Changed:
  - saved_recipes.html
  - search_page.html
Functionality Added/Worked on:
 Both
    Figured out how to use Github workflow (branches, pull, and merge).
  Valerie - search_page.html
    Reformatted sections (made six different recipe cards - we will add more once we have the data for all the recipes, this is just for formatting the CSS). This page will showcase all the recipes and will be
    filtered based on what the user is looking for. Started adding filter options (specifically the type of meal). Plan to have text filter, star rating filter, and type of meal filter.
  Dristi - saved_recipes.html
    Got rid of some content in the saved recipes. Creating a template for a recipe card so we can use for handlebars.

11/27/2024 5-6PM - Valerie HTML Work Session
Files changed:
  - search_page.html
Functionality Added/Worked on:
  Finished the filters (text, star rating, type of meal filters). CSS can start. Planning to add little images for the star rating filters rather than text and including a search icon in the search bar.
