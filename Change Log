This file is for updating the rest of the team on progress made after working. Templating for updates:
  - Date, Time (for deconflicting parallel work)
  - Files changed
  - Functionality added, notes missing that you need to add, functionality not yet complete
  - Importantly, please note any issues you run into or confusion you have, so the rest of the team can support you and we don't run into a slowdown.
