11/22/24 7:30 - 8:30PM - Valerie and Dristi HTML Work Session
Files Added & Changed:
  - index.html
  - saved_recipes.html
  - search_page.html
Functionality Added/Worked on:
We made .html files for the different pages of the webpage. We worked on the linking functionality between pages. On the home page (index.html), we made a recipe of the day section and a top recipes section.
The saved recipes and search sections have the same code as the home page currently, but we will make changes to these next time we meet. Additionaly, we decided that when we press on a certain recipe card,
a modal display of the recipe will be shown rather than a whole other page. We will work on implementing this next time we meet.
Issues/Confusions:
  - Figuring out how to push work onto Github (using branches)
  - We somehow could not push our work to the main branch as it said that there was information that on the local that was not on the remote. 
  

11/24/2024 7:30 - 8:30PM - Valerie and Dristi HTML Work Session
Files Changed:
  - saved_recipes.html
  - search_page.html
Functionality Added/Worked on:
 Both
    Figured out how to use Github workflow (branches, pull, and merge).
  Valerie - search_page.html
    Reformatted sections (made six different recipe cards - we will add more once we have the data for all the recipes, this is just for formatting the CSS). This page will showcase all the recipes and will be
    filtered based on what the user is looking for. Started adding filter options (specifically the type of meal). Plan to have text filter, star rating filter, and type of meal filter.
  Dristi - saved_recipes.html
    Got rid of some content in the saved recipes. Creating a template for a recipe card so we can use for handlebars.

11/27/2024 5-6PM - Valerie HTML Work Session
Files changed:
  - search_page.html
Functionality Added/Worked on:
  Finished the filters (text, star rating, type of meal filters). CSS can start. Planning to add little images for the star rating filters rather than text and including a search icon in the search bar. 

11/29/2024 3:30PM - 4:45PM - Anthony CSS Work Session
Files Added & Changed:
  - style.css
Functionality Added/Worked on:
  Created the css file that was based on the previous template. Edited the header with a black background and a white text. Decided to center align the text within the recipe cards as well as the title for the homepage.
  (In-Progress) Looking to format the buttons correctly, add photos to the website, and would like to center the title for the search page.

11/30/2024 4:15PM-4:50PM - Anthony CSS Work Session
Files Changed:
  - style.css
Functionlity Added/Worked on:
  Added some padding within the recipes-grid and modal-heading. Also replaced the header background-color from black to purple, to look more like the concept design.
  Also changed the filter input background color.

12/1/2024 5-6PM - Valerie HTML & CSS Work Session
Files Changed:
  - index.html
  - search_page.html
  - saved_recipes.html
Functionality Added/Worked on:
  Changed the navigation tabs (removed home and now when you press "Food For You" you are redirected back to home page & fixed styling of it). Added all sample recipe cards to search page and added a post to 
  saved recipes page. Added sample recipe cards to the webpage (need to add some kind of implementation to "save" recipe - maybe by pressing a star a property of the recipe is set to true and the recipe is added
  to the saved recipes page). Added social media logos and clicking on them goes to their specific pages. Added caption to saved recipes pages that explains how to save a recipe and what exactly you can do on the saved
  recipes page (add new recipes which will automatically be added to your saved recipes and edit recipes with your notes).
Need to Do for HTML & CSS:
  - Add new recipe button
  - Edit recipe button
  - Save recipe button
  - Want to make recipe of the day have a longer width rather than height to make it stand out (need to figure out how to do - so far made an id for it)
  - Make recipe page when you click on a recipe with information (instructions, ingredients, etc.) - JS Side too
  - Center title for search page
  - make our own logos (for fun - if we have time)
  - make about page (for fun - if we have time)

  Compressed h1 and the search bar margins and added padding from the left for both h1 and search bar. Also added background color to match the header with h1, search bar, and filter input.

12/2/2024 ~12-1PM - Brandon Beene - Begin Server-side JS work
Files changed: N/A 
  - Moved index.html, search_page.html, saved_recipes.html, index.js, style.css into "Static" directory for use with Handlebars.
Files Created: 
  - recipe-cardData.JSON : this file holds information to be used in recipe card elements. We discussed adding client side functionality to click on these and take the user to "link-to-recipe" URL where the user can see a recipe page.
  - saved_recipes.JSON this file holds information to be used in saved recipes. This is going to be essentially the same thing as the cards, but these are specifically the ones that the user has saved.
  - server.js : blank until I work on it later
  - added directory structure to have views/layouts/main.handlebars and views/partials/*needed handlebars* and views/*needed handlebars*.
  - added recipe-card.handlebars and body.handlebars under views/
  - added header.handlebars, footer.handlebars as partials under views/partials. We may not need these but just in case. can reformat as needed.
Of note:
  - Not ready to remove index.html, still working on getting everything into templates. Even when we do remove index.html, I want to retain a copy we can reference in case we need to.
  - Commit went through smoothly and retained Anthony's .css changes.
